Recently the <a href=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211 target="_blank">LIGO<a/>
scientists have detected massive 
gravity waves travelling through space.

These 'Gravity Waves' are caused by two blackholes
each about 30 times the mass of our sun
spinning & merging together into one.

The forces involved are so unimaginably huge
releasing 50 times more energy than 
all the stars in the observable universe
happening in a fraction of a second.

These gravitational wave frequencies can be translated into sound,
Stretching & rearranging these sounds helped to make this track.

The first rising break is of two Neutron stars
encircling each other, almost merging then falling back away.

This 'Neutron Star Dance' is impossible, 
as once they are trapped in each others gravity 
the stars will most certainly collide,
An event that could even create a black hole.

The second buildup is the gravitational wave sound of
two blackholes merging in an elliptical orbit.

Imagine that this composition is of the instruments from a 
future spacecraft would sound like as it zips through
spacetime avoiding these cataclysmic incidents.

It is a shame electronic music is not more popular where i'm from,
as it seems the thing that holds us all together sound just like it.

Credits to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory 
also to Professor Scott A Hughes for the Gravity Wave samples!

<b>Update 2020<b> - <a href=https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=ChWqWsZk_D0&list=RDAMVMChWqWsZk_D0 target="_blank">This</a> was created in 2016,
it has only just occurred to me that if living beings craft did hear this track 
it is something they would immediately identify as an intelligent signal,
Possibly even as an intergalactic S.O.S.
